    "Water companies in the UK were privatised in 1989 and, as most water companies are regional monopolies, household customers cannot select their water company (Hunt, June 2020).  Water companies are governed by Ofwat, the economic regulator, and must submit returns as part of a 5-year cycle price review process (the current regulatory period is known as PR19, the next regulatory period will be PR24). \n",

    "In March 2023 the scientific journals Water, Environments, Forests and Remote Sensing, called for submission of papers on the topic “Remote Sensing in Water Resources Management Models” (Deng et al, abstract submission closing January 2023) validating the need for research focused on water resource management in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "A standard method for tracking water consumption is through calculation of per capita consumption (PCC) (litres of water used per person per day (Tamason et al, November 2016 & Crouch et al, August 2021). One of many performance commitments for water companies, is to reduce their PCC by an agreed number of litres per person per day (Ofwat, July 2021), the gold standard being between 100 and 120 litres per person per day (Anglian Water, October 2019 and Southern Water, October 2022). Calculation of PCC relies heavily on accurate population statistics at a district metered area (DMA) level and metering of all households. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all households within the UK are metered with meter penetration being as low as 30% in some areas (Waterwise, September 2020). Meter reading can prove challenging due to limited access to properties, the high cost of manual and drive by meter readings and reluctance of customers to actively share details of their personal water consumption with water companies.  To date, evidence shared with households on the impact of water consumption on their environment has been restricted mostly to theoretical statements or less than robust statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides code for the first phase of analysis into driers of water demand. It is hoped that it will encourage researchers and  developers to further explore how additional measurements such as built up indices, landuse classification, correlation of building age with high consumption, as examples, can be be used to understand drivers of PCC and thus manage/influence future water demand/consumption by creating impirical evidenceto support adoption of sustainable water efficient behaviours. \n",

    "Data used is publically available data, the intention being to supplement this further with more advanced python scripting in the future, Google Earth Engine analysis and water company specific data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing household consumption by a few litres per person per day is not the complete solution to attaining long-term sustainability. In addition to exploring drivers of consumption, the hypothesis that increasing household consumption is the root cause of increasing water demand in areas with recorded high PCC can be challenged if the relationship between leakage, non-household and household consumption and how this correlates with land use changes over time can be better understood.   \n",

    "For the module PCASKmean_updated to be called, the following packages need to be installed: cv2 (OpenCV library for image processing), numpy, sklearn (KMeans and PCA processing), collections (counting occurrences of elements),  PIL (Python Imaging Library for image-related operations), imageio (reading and writing different image formats), os and math (mathematical functions and constants).\n",
    "\n",
    "Imageio has been imported as imageio.v2 to suppress warning errors resulting from use of later versions of the package.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The follow functions are defined in the module: \n",
    "\n",
    "***find_PCAKmeans(imagepath1, imagepath2):*** This is the main function that takes two image paths as inputs and performs change detection. It reads the images, resizes them, calculates the difference image, performs PCA on the difference image, and prepares the feature vector space (FVS).\n",
    "\n",
    "***find_vector_set(diff_image, new_size):*** This function divides the difference image into smaller blocks, extracts feature vectors from each block, and calculates the mean vector from all the feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "***find_FVS(EVS, diff_image, mean_vec, new):*** This function extracts blocks from the difference image, flattens them into feature vectors, combines them into a feature vector space, and transforms the feature vector space using PCA by multiplying it with the eigenvectors and subtracting the mean vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "***clustering(FVS, components, new):*** This function performs K-means clustering on the feature vector space. It assigns each feature vector to a cluster, identifies the least common cluster as a reference for change detection, reshapes the cluster assignments into a change map, and returns the least common cluster index and the change map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module saves the change map and clean change map as image files, provides the image paths and calls the find_PCAKmeans function to execute the change detection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change map and clean change map are saved in the directory data_files in a folder called test_data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The images (20200327.jpeg and 20230208.jpeg) used for this example were downloaded from SentinelAPI using the method described above and are used for illustrative purposes only.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:  These images have not been preprocessed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the code is executed the following will appear:\n",
    "- A message indicating that the file is in the process of executing (Operating)\n",
    "- The dimensions of the input images (height and width in number of pixels and number of channels)\n",
    "- The size of the resized images (calculated by rounding up the original size to the nearest multiple of 5)\n",
    "- The size of the feature vector space (FVS) that is created\n",
    "- A message indicating that the K-means clustering algorithm is being performed on the feature vector space (computing k means)\n",
    "- The dimensions (height and width in pixels) of the change map \n",
    "- A message indicating that the code execution is complete \n",
    "\n",
