Please work through the Jupyter Notebook Tutorial called Tutorial_Water_Demand.ipynb if you are interested in this topic and would like to contribute.

Notes: 
The environment.yml file may contain more dependencies than required as it has been autocreated to mirror the local conda environment. 
The tutorial was created for a Windows operating system. Amendments may be required for iOS or Linux.
