    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why understanding of household water consumption drivers is critical, these include increasing w  scarcity due to, amongst other factors, population growth, climate change, and changing weather patterns. By understanding the drivers of household water consumption, policymakers and water companies can develop effective strategies to manage water resources, reduce wastage, and ensure sustainable water supplies for the future. Increased abstraction for consumption places pressure on freshwater ecosystems, reduces river flows, and depletes groundwater resources whilst production, treatment and distribution of potable water increases energy consumption, increases carbon emissions all of which come with financial and non-financial costs. Infrastructure planning, policy amendments and behavioural change educational campaigns and initiatives require detailed understanding of the drivers of ever increasing water consumption if  water scarcity, escalating costs and environmental impacts are to be managed so that net zero positions can be reached and behavioural change can be embedded in order to ensure sustainable water management for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Literature searches on remote sensing to understand and manage water demand yeld limited results. In March 2023 the scientific journals Water, Environments, Forests and Remote Sensing, called for submission of papers on the topic “Remote Sensing in Water Resources Management Models” (Ref https://www.mdpi.com/topics/Remote_Sensing_Water) indicating that there is a desire for further research focused on water resource management in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "A standard method for tracking water consumption is through calculation of per capita consumption (PCC) (litres of water used per person per day). One of the many performance commitments for water companies, is to reduce their PCC by an agreed numebr of litres per year, the gold standard being 100 litres per person per day. Calculation of PCC relies heavily on accurate population statistics at a district metered area level and metering of all households. Not all households within the UK are metered with meter penetration being below 60% in some areas. Where meter data exists, meter reading can prove challenging.  To date evidence shared with households on the impact of water consumption on their environment have been restricted to theoretical statements. A more robust method of depicting water consumption at a district metered area level, without the need to meter every household, would provide evidence to communities of their overall impact on water consumption and provide valuable input into behavioural change campaigns whilst also providing water companies insight into which areas to target smart meter installations as a longer term solution to achieving individual accountability for increasing household consumption.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of water companies to reduce household consumption relies heavy on behavioural change interventions to encourage lower water consumption, kickback from consumers is that water companies are not doing their bit in reducing leakage - this results in people being less motivated to reduce their water consumption.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The components of this dashboard will provide a simple to use interface to non-technical users whilst encouraging  technical developers to further explore how measurements such as built up indices, landuse classification. correlation of building age with high consumption (the hypothesis being that older households may have unknown customer side leakage) can be be used to understand drivers of PCC and to share impirical evidence with consumers to encourage adoption of sustainable water efficient behaviours. Data used is publically available data, the intention being to supplement this further with Google Earth Engine analysis and water company specific data with a view of challenging the hypothesis that increasing household consumption is the root cause of increasing water demand in areas with recorded high PCC.  \n",
